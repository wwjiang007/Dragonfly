# This file is the template of supernode configuration file.
# You can configure your supernode by change the parameter according your requirement.
---
base:
  # ListenPort is the port supernode server listens on.
  # default: 8002
  listenPort: 8002

  # DownloadPort is the port for download files from supernode.
  # And you should start a file server firstly which listens on the download port.
  # default: 8001
  downloadPort: 8001

  # HomeDir is working directory of supernode.
  # default: /home/admin/supernode
  homeDir: /home/admin/supernode

  # the core pool size of ScheduledExecutorService.
  # When a request to start a download task, supernode will construct a thread concurrent pool
  # to download pieces of source file and write to specified storage.
  # Note: source file downloading is into pieces via range attribute set in HTTP header.
  # default: 10
  schedulerCorePoolSize: 10

  # PeerUpLimit is the upload limit of a peer. When dfget starts to play a role of peer,
  # it can only stand PeerUpLimit upload tasks from other peers.
  # default: 5
  peerUpLimit: 5

  # PeerDownLimit is the download limit of a peer. When a peer starts to download a file/image,
  # it will download file/image in the form of pieces. PeerDownLimit mean that a peer can only
  # stand starting PeerDownLimit concurrent downloading tasks.
  # default: 4
  peerDownLimit: 4

  # When dfget node starts to play a role of peer, it will provide services for other peers
  # to pull pieces. If it runs into an issue when providing services for a peer, its self failure
  # increases by 1. When the failure limit reaches EliminationLimit, the peer will isolate itself
  # as a unhealthy state. Then this dfget will be no longer called by other peers.
  # default: 5
  eliminationLimit: 5

  # FailureCountLimit is the failure count limit set in supernode for dfget client.
  # When a dfget client takes part in the peer network constructed by supernode,
  # supernode will command the peer to start distribution task.
  # When dfget client fails to finish distribution task, the failure count of client
  # increases by 1. When failure count of client reaches to FailureCountLimit(default 5),
  # dfget client will be moved to blacklist of supernode to stop playing as a peer.
  # default: 5
  failureCountLimit: 5

  # SystemReservedBandwidth is the network bandwidth reserved for system software.
  # default: 20 MB, in format of G(B)/g/M(B)/m/K(B)/k/B, pure number will also be parsed as Byte.
  systemReservedBandwidth: 20M

  # MaxBandwidth is the network bandwidth that supernode can use.
  # default: 200 MB, in format of G(B)/g/M(B)/m/K(B)/k/B, pure number will also be parsed as Byte.
  maxBandwidth: 200M

  # Whether to enable profiler
  # default: false
  enableProfiler: false

  # Whether to open DEBUG level
  # default: false
  debug: false

  # FailAccessInterval is the interval time after failed to access the URL.
  # If a task failed to be downloaded from the source, it will not be retried in the time since the last failure.
  # default: 3m
  failAccessInterval: 3m

  # gc related

  # GCInitialDelay is the delay time from the start to the first GC execution.
  # default: 6s
  gcInitialDelay: 6s

  # GCMetaInterval is the interval time to execute GC meta.
  # default: 2m0s
  gcMetaInterval: 2m

  # TaskExpireTime when a task is not accessed within the taskExpireTime,
  # and it will be treated to be expired.
  # default: 3m0s
  taskExpireTime: 3m

  # PeerGCDelay is the delay time to execute the GC after the peer has reported the offline.
  # default: 3m0s
  peerGCDelay: 3m

  # GCDiskInterval is the interval time to execute GC disk.
  # default: 15s
  gcDiskInterval: 15s

  # YoungGCThreshold if the available disk space is more than YoungGCThreshold
  # and there is no need to GC disk.
  # default: 100GB
  youngGCThreshold: 100G

  #  FullGCThreshold if the available disk space is less than FullGCThreshold
  #  and the supernode should gc all task files which are not being used.
  #  default: 5GB
  fullGCThreshold: 5G

  # IntervalThreshold is the threshold of the interval at which the task file is accessed.
  # default: 2h0m0s
  IntervalThreshold: 2h
